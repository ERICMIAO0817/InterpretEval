by Pengfei Liu, Jinlan Fu, Graham Neubig and other contributors.


## Motivated Questions

<img src="fig/ner.gif" width="450">

* #### Performance of many NLP tasks has reached a plateau. What works, and what's next?
* #### <strong>Is XX a solved task? What's left?</strong>
* #### A good evaluation metric can not only rank different systems but also tell their relative advantages (strengths and weaknesses) of them.



## Interpretable Evaluation Methodology






## Application


### ExplainaBoard: Next Generation of LeaderBoard


### System Diagnosis
* Self-diagnosis
* Aided-diagnosis


### Dataset Bias Analysis


### Structural Bias Analysis 









## Interpreting Your Results?


### Method 1: Upload your files to  the ``ExplainaBoard`` website



### Method 2: Run it Locally

```
   Notably, so far, our system only supports limited tasks and datasets, we're extending them currently!
```

Here are some generated results of preliminary evaluation systems: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) and Part-of-Speech (POS).
